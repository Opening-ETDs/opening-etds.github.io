title: "Assistant Dean and Director of IT, University Libraries, Virginia Tech"
bio: "My research explores the application of computational methods and techniques for large-scale digital library collections. Specifically, I work within the fields of digital library theory, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, and information retrieval, employing related methods from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. I strongly endorse the model of \"collections as data,\" which leverages computational methods and tools for interacting with library collections in the digital space."
