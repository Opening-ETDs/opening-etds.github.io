Theses and dissertations contain a wealth of knowledge reflecting graduate students' exploration in a scholarly domain. Although print submission was common practice early on, ETDs have become the predominant format for submitting, archiving, and disseminating graduate work. Over the past 25 years, millions of ETDs have been created, collected, and shared with the world through online digital repositories run by university libraries and scholarly publishing companies. Paper theses and dissertations have been replaced with PDFs; but for the most part, digital collections aren't much different than the analog libraries they replaced. Online digital libraries of ETDs have greatly increased the exposure of graduate research, nonetheless, they fail to meet the needs of researchers, who find it hard to discover and access the knowledge buried in these long documents. The worldwide collection of ETDs has grown to become â€œscholarly big data'' (Giles, 2013), consisting of myriad facts and descriptions of new knowledge, tables and figures, terms and definitions, references and literature reviews. There is a growing demand among researchers for collections of scholarly content to support computationally-driven research. This paper describes our efforts to create a computationally amenable corpus of ETDs. We use ideas and techniques from bibliometrics, machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing to mine knowledge from this rich information source. We examine some of the challenges we face, discuss our methods, and explore the results.
