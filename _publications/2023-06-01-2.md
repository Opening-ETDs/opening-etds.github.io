Electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) contain valuable knowledge that can be useful in a wide range of research areas. Accordingly, we are
building electronic infrastructure leveraging advanced work on digital libraries,
for discovering and accessing the knowledge buried in ETDs. In this paper we
focus on our work to incorporate topic modeling into digital libraries for ETDs.
We present ETD-Topics, a framework that extracts topics from a large text corpus in an unsupervised way. The representations learnt from topic models can
be useful for downstream tasks such as searching and/or browsing documents
by topic, document recommendation, topic recommendation, and describing
temporal topic trends (e.g., from the perspective of disciplines or universities).
