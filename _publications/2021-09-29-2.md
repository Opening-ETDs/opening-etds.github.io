Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) contain
domain knowledge that can be used for many digital library
tasks, such as analyzing citation networks and predicting research
trends. Automatic metadata extraction is important to build
scalable digital library search engines. Most existing methods
are designed for born-digital documents such as GROBID,
CERMINE, and ParsCit, so they often fail to extract metadata
from scanned documents such as for ETDs. Traditional sequence
tagging methods mainly rely on text-based features. In this
paper, we propose a conditional random field (CRF) model that
combines text-based and visual features. To verify the robustness
of our model, we extended an existing corpus and created a new
ground truth corpus consisting of 500 ETD cover pages with
human validated metadata. Our experiments show that CRF
with visual features outperformed both a heuristic baseline and
a CRF model with only text-based features. The proposed model
achieved 81.3%-96% F1 measure on seven metadata fields. The
data and source code are publicly available on Google Drive
and a GitHub repository, respectively.
